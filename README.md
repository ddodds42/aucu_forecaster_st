# streamlit_demo

Run
```
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

req.txt was just the file I used for initial setup before I ran
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
to create the requirements.txt with all dependencies.

The code used to iterate models for this tool is in [this repo.](https://github.com/ddodds42/Predictive_Analytics_Business_Licensing)
